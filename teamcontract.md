CS 225: Runtime Terror 4

Group Project Contract

The members of the team Runtime Terror 4 agree to abide by the following guidelines:

Communication


Team Meetings

Weekly team meetings will be held on Friday at 2pm at ECEB. Team members are expected to be present at each meeting and arrive on time. 
If a member is unable to attend a meeting, they must let the other members know in advance and take the initiative to get caught up on 
whatever was discussed in the meeting. If the team is running behind their schedule of the project, additional meetings can be added 
during a week with the agreement of all the members. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker starting from abiswas7. 


Assistance

The team members have been communicating and will continue to communicate on Instagram direct messages. The team members are expected to
respond as soon as possible, and usually within 24 hours. If any problems are encountered in the project when the members are working on 
their individual parts, it must be conveyed to the other members immediately. The members will work together on overcoming the problem faced. 
Each member can also individually be contacted through email.


Respect

Every member agrees to make every team meeting an environment which encourages open expression of ideas. Every member will have an opportunity 
to speak and express their opinions and ideas. Every other member will actively listen and engage with the thoughts of other members. Decisions 
will be based on the majority vote -- while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. 



Collaboration 


Work Distribution 

Each week, the members will decide on the tasks for that particular week and assign every member a task, such that the work distribution is equal. 
Every member is expected to complete their task by the self-imposed deadline. If for any reason there is an unbalanced workload for a particular week, 
it will be made up for and balanced in the following. 


Time Commitment

To ensure that each member puts in the same amount of work and dedicates the same amount of time into the project, each member is expected to work no 
less than 2 hours and no more than 10 hours. However, if a deliverable is taking more time than expected, all the members will equally distribute the 
extra work and time needed to complete the deliverable. 
Although each member will be assigned a task, it is the groupâ€™s responsibility as a whole to ensure that the deliverable for that week is completed. 

Conflict Resolution 


If there is conflict between two members, they will try to resolve it in a polite and civil manner. If they are unable to resolve the conflict, the 
matter will be brought up with other group members who will then come to a final decision with respect to the conflict. If all the members unanimously 
are not able to resolve the conflict or cause more conflicts, the matter will be brought up to a neutral third person party who will then help resolve 
the problem.
